#Desciption of Project
#In this assignment, we built a survey to learn about students' lifestyle on campus. My survey focused on students' favorite bar/restaurant on campus.

#Best Practices
#One good thing I did on this assignment was the background and font colors. I chose gold and black because it's a University of Iowa survey. The colors 
fit the survey well and gave it a Hawkeye feel to it. 

#Another good thing I felt that I did was giving the survey participant enough options for each question. Because I asked a variety of characteristics, I 
needed to provide many options that could fit the description.

#My last good practice that I incorporated into this assignment was the box around all of the questions on both page 1 & 2. In terms of formatting, it 
simply looks cleaner. The legend title for both pages look good as well with the titles "Student Information" and "Survey Questions".

#Overall, I feel like I did a solid job on this assignment. It was fun to play around and tweak the formatting for the pages. Also, I was happy to figure 
how to create the azure URL all on my own without the help in-class. That was a step in the right direction for me.
